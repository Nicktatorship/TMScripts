To install scripts into blender they must go in a special folder.
Upon installed the Blender program it will ask you where to install another folder where scripts are found.
This folder is called ".BLEND"

If you keep the default location then it could be placed in an invisible folder.
c:\Users\(your user name)\appdat\blender

You will have to turn off hidden folders are hidden in your folder settings to find it.

Or uninstall Blender and re-install it and make sure at that step to install the .BLEND folder in the exact location where you installed blender in the first place.
And you would place the scripts here: C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender\.blender\scripts

So it's easier to find. Or in your documents folder if you choose that location.

Do not use blender 2.5 or later with the scripts.
And make sure you have python 2.6.2 installed also.
If you have python "HotFixed" into Blender already then you are good to go.
